# Project Title: Dataset Cleaning with Cross Tabulation Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning datasets by filling missing values using **Cross Tabulation Analysis**. The method ensures accurate imputation by leveraging the relationships between different features in the dataset. By creating and analyzing contingency tables, the project determines the most probable values for missing data, based on their co-occurrence with other features.

## Key Features

1. **Filling Missing Values**
   - Missing values in the dataset are filled based on the relationships between other features.
   - The Cross Tabulation Analysis method is employed to maintain data integrity.

2. **Cross Tabulation Analysis**
   - Contingency Tables are created to analyze the frequency of co-occurring values in the dataset.
   - The table indexes rows and columns using values from one or more features.
   - Each cell in the table represents the count (or frequency) of co-occurrence for specific feature values.

3. **High Frequency as a Predictor**
   - High frequency in the contingency table indicates high relative frequency, which translates to high probability.
   - These probabilities guide the imputation of missing values, ensuring the filled data aligns with the dataset's inherent patterns.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Identify missing values in the dataset.
   - Select features influencing the missing values.

2. **Contingency Table Creation**
   - Generate a contingency table indexing rows and columns by chosen features.
   - Count occurrences of values to populate the table.

3. **Imputation**
   - Analyze the contingency table to identify the most probable values for missing data.
   - Fill missing values based on these probabilities.

## Benefits

- **Accuracy:** Ensures missing values are filled based on logical and statistical reasoning.
- **Data Integrity:** Maintains the consistency and relationships between features.
- **Flexibility:** The method can adapt to datasets with different structures and dependencies.

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset:**
   - Import your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Identify Missing Values:**
   - Use tools like `df.isnull().sum()` to locate missing values.

3. **Create Contingency Tables:**
   - Use `pd.crosstab()` or similar functions to generate tables.

4. **Analyze and Fill Missing Values:**
   - Evaluate high-frequency co-occurrences and impute missing values accordingly.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and contingency table creation.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**
  - Used for implementation and visualization.
